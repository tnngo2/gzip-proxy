# gzip-proxy

A reversed proxy prototype to perform gzip the networks request before returning responses to client.

I use this proto to measure the performance between non-gzip and gzip applications.

## Installation:
```
npm install
```

## Starting proxy
```
node proxy.js
```

## Set proxy setting in browsers
```
